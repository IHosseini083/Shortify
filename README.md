## Introduction

_Shortify_ is a fast, fully async and reliable URL shortener RESTful API built with Python and [FastAPI] framework.
It uses the open source [MongoDB] database for storing shortened URLs data and implements user registration via
OAuth2 JWT authentication.

## Features

- Fully async and non-blocking.
- Uses [FastAPI] framework for API development:
- Uses [MongoDB] as data store for users and shortened URLs.
- Extensible architecture for adding new API endpoints and services.
- Descriptive and well-documented code.
- OAuth2 (with hashed passwords and JWT tokens) based user authentication.
- Uses [Poetry] for dependency management.
- Automated code formatting and linting with [pre-commit] and [black].
- [CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) support.
- Pagination support for listing shortened URLs and users.
- Structured logging with [structlog].
- Correlation ID middleware for logging and tracing requests across services.
- Class-based API endpoints for better code organization and reducing duplication.
- Fully type annotated code for better IDE support and code quality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- [Poetry] for dependency management.
- Up and running [MongoDB] instance (locally or remotely).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IHosseini083/Shortify.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

You need to configure [Poetry] to place the virtual environment in the project directory. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
poetry config --local virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

If you're on Linux, you can just skip all the above steps and run the `scripts/install` script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install  # make the script executable
./scripts/install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

You can see the table of all environment variables below. Those marked with `*` are required and **MUST** be set before
running the application. Rest of them are optional and have default values.

**Note:** To set any of these environment variables, you **MUST** prefix them with `SHORTIFY_` and then set them in your
shell or in a `.env` file placed at `shortify/.env`.
For example, to set `DEBUG` environment variable, you can do the following:

```bash
export SHORTIFY_DEBUG=True
```

Also note that **ALL** environment variables are **CASE SENSITIVE**.

### 4. Run the application

#### In development mode

If you want to run the application in development mode, you can simply run the following command in the project directory,
and it will start the application with [uvicorn] server on `localhost:8000`:

```bash
python -m shortify
```

If the `DEBUG` environment variable is set to `True`, the application will be run in debug mode and will be reloaded
automatically on code changes. If you're using [VSCode], you can use the debugger to debug the application by pressing
`F5` key.

#### In production mode

But if you're going to run the application in production (e.g. On a VPS), you can use a production-ready server like [gunicorn]
along-side [uvicorn]. You can do that by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker shortify.app.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

That will start the application on `SERVER_IP:8000`.

## Documentation and Usage

After running the application, you can access the OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation at `/v1/docs` endpoint.
