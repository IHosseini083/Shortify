## Introduction

_Shortify_ is a fast, fully async and reliable URL shortener RESTful API built with Python and [FastAPI] framework.
It uses the open source [MongoDB] database for storing shortened URLs data and implements user registration via
OAuth2 JWT authentication.

## Features

- Fully async and non-blocking.
- Uses [FastAPI] framework for API development:
- Uses [MongoDB] as data store for users and shortened URLs.
- Extensible architecture for adding new API endpoints and services.
- Descriptive and well-documented code.
- OAuth2 (with hashed passwords and JWT tokens) based user authentication.
- Uses [Poetry] for dependency management.
- Automated code formatting and linting with [pre-commit] and [black].
- [CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) support.
- Pagination support for listing shortened URLs and users.
- Structured logging with [structlog].
- Correlation ID middleware for logging and tracing requests across services.
- Class-based API endpoints for better code organization and reducing duplication.
- Fully type annotated code for better IDE support and code quality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- [Poetry] for dependency management.
- Up and running [MongoDB] instance (locally or remotely).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IHosseini083/Shortify.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

You need to configure [Poetry] to place the virtual environment in the project directory. To do so, run the following
command:

```bash
poetry config --local virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

If you're on Linux, you can just skip all the above steps and run the `scripts/install` script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install  # make the script executable
./scripts/install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

You can see the table of all environment variables below. Those marked with `*` are required and **MUST** be set before
running the application. Rest of them are optional and have default values.

**Note:** To set any of these environment variables, you **MUST** prefix them with `SHORTIFY_` and then set them in your
shell or in a `.env` file placed at `shortify/.env`.
For example, to set `DEBUG` environment variable, you can do the following:

```bash
export SHORTIFY_DEBUG=True
```

Also note that **ALL** environment variables are **CASE SENSITIVE**.

### 4. Run the application

#### In development mode

If you want to run the application in development mode, you can simply run the following command in the project
directory,
and it will start the application with [uvicorn] server on `localhost:8000`:

```bash
python -m shortify
```

If the `DEBUG` environment variable is set to `True`, the application will be run in debug mode and will be reloaded
automatically on code changes. If you're using [VSCode], you can use the debugger to debug the application by pressing
`F5` key.

#### In production mode

But if you're going to run the application in production (e.g. On a VPS), you can use a production-ready server
like [gunicorn]
along-side [uvicorn]. You can do that by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker shortify.app.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

That will start the application on `SERVER_IP:8000`.

## Documentation and Usage

After running the application, you can access the OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation at `/api/v1/docs` endpoint.

## Project Structure, Modifications and Best Practices

Structure of `shortify` folder containing main files and folders of the application is consistent and straightforward
and just by looking at module names it gives you an idea of what's inside it!

```
./shortify
│    .env.sample        # Sample .env file for setting environment variables
│    __init__.py
│    __main__.py        # Runs the development server
├─── app                # Primary app folder
│   │    main.py        # Contains FastAPI application and its settings
│   │    __init__.py    # Contains project version variable
│   ├─── api            # All API views/routes are here
│   ├─── core           # Core configs and utils for the application
│   ├─── db             # Database initialization and session (if needded)
│   ├─── middlewares    # ASGI middlewares for FastAPI application
│   ├─── models         # Database models
│   ├─── schemas        # Pydantic schemas
│   ├─── static         # Static files served at /static endpoint
│   ├─── utils          # Utilites used by the API
```

### Creating new API routes

To create new API routes and add them to your main application, you need to create new `fastapi.APIRouter` instances or
use the existing ones depending on the endpoint you need to implement. All API routers for API version one (v1) are
located at `shortify/app/api/v1/endpoints` folder and then grouped together in `shortify/app/api/v1/__init__.py` file by
including
them in a separate `fastapi.APIRouter` instance that will be added to main app:

```python
# shortify/app/api/v1/__init__.py
from fastapi import APIRouter

from shortify.app.api.v1.endpoints import auth, urls, users
from shortify.app.core.config import settings

router = APIRouter(prefix=f"/{settings.API_V1_STR}")
router.include_router(auth.router, prefix="/auth", tags=["Authentication"])
router.include_router(users.router, prefix="/users", tags=["Users"])
router.include_router(urls.router, prefix="/urls", tags=["URLs"])
```

Now let's say you want to add a new router for statistics about short URLs and then add it to your main app, this is how
you're going to do it:

1. Create new module named `stats.py` in `shortify/app/api/v1/endpoints` package.
2. Create an `fastapi.APIRouter` instance in `stats.py` module.

```python
# shortify/app/api/v1/endpoints/stats.py
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()
```

3. E.g. Create an API route to get most visited short URLs in descending order

```python
# shortify/app/api/v1/endpoints/stats.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
from typing import List
from shortify.app.models import ShortUrl

router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/most-visited")
async def get_most_visited_urls(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10) -> List[ShortUrl]:
    # Sort URLs in descending order based on their views
    return await ShortUrl.find(skip=skip, limit=limit).sort(-ShortUrl.views).to_list()
```

You could also implement the route using class-based views decorator but since we don't have any dependencies or code
duplications, this approach was simply enough for our use-case.

4. Finally, add the newly created router to the main router for version one

```python
# shortify/app/api/v1/__init__.py
from fastapi import APIRouter

from shortify.app.api.v1.endpoints import stats
from shortify.app.core.config import settings

router = APIRouter(prefix=f"/{settings.API_V1_STR}")
# Other routers omitted for brevity
router.include_router(stats.router, prefix="/stats", tags=["Statistics"])
```

5. That's it! now you can see the created endpoint in your API docs.
